	<p>There are quite a few things wrong with Alex. He can't spell, do maths, or keep his mouth shut inside LRC Bagnall.</p>
	<p class="mt-5">These negative aspects associated with his personality tend to deter people from becoming friends with him.</p>
	<p class="mt-5">This means that he is currently uncontrollably falling down a path of <i>spiralling social anxiety</i>.</p>
